# Chevrolet HHR

I loved the retro styling of the HHR and it was a practical hatchback. It had a distinctive look that set it apart from the look alikes of sedans, hatchbacks, and SUVs. The Chevrolet HHR is a great, little, CUV (Compact Utility Vehicle), as classified by [South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles](https://www.scdmvonline.com/). With the rear seats down, which was all the time, it had enough cargo capacity for the two of us, with our two Beagles.

## 2011 Chevrolet HHR

### Sunroof Repair

This frame is needed because the driver side pivot hold down is broken. When the sunroof is retracted, the slide arm that is supposed lower the wind baffle springs up, requiring two people to close the sunroof: 
1. one person is needed outside to hold the arm down for the window
2. the other person is needed inside to push the button to close the sunroof.

### 2011 Chevrolet HHR 2.4L I-4 Enable Remote Start?

This part is for HHR's built with remote starting. I don't think that Chevrolet would have different PROMs for specific features in a car. I think that this part will tell the HHR whether the hood is open or closed, if it will autostart. I read on an HHR forum where grounding a pin in the interior fuse box will enable remote starting.

## OnStar Functionality Impacted by US Cellular CDMA 2G Sunset 

Canada sunsetted cellular 2G CDMA technology in 2015. [GM Canada](https://www.gm.ca/) 🇨🇦  figured out how to retain OnStar functionality in affected vehicles without using a dongle that plugs into the ODB-II port, which is [GM USA](https://www.gm.com/) 🇺🇸  solution. A dongle that plugs into the ODB-II port is unacceptable to me.

## Chevrolet HHR 

| *"Ralph Hightower"* / [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) |
|----|
| *"Hello Assistant."* |
| Hello! How can I assist you today?|
| *"Are you familiar with the Chevrolet HHR?"* |
|Yes, the Chevrolet HHR (Heritage High Roof) is a retro-styled compact car that was produced by General Motors from 2005 to 2011. It was based on the same platform as the Chevrolet Cobalt and shared many of its mechanical components. The HHR was marketed as a versatile vehicle that combined the functionality of an SUV with the maneuverability of a compact car. It was available in a variety of trim levels and engine options, including a high-performance SS version with a turbocharged engine.|
| *"Was it very popular?"* |
|The Chevrolet HHR had a mixed reception during its production years. While it had a distinctive retro look that some customers found appealing, others criticized it for its boxy design and limited interior space. Sales of the HHR were initially strong in the United States, but they began to decline in later years as competition from other compact SUVs and crossovers increased. Despite this, the HHR still has a dedicated fan base, and many owners appreciate its practicality and unique style.|
| *"Are  there any retro styled vehicles still in production? Or has the retro look disappeared?"* |
|Yes, there are still some retro-styled vehicles in production today. The most notable examples include:|
| 1. Volkswagen Beetle - Although production of the iconic "Bug" ended in 2019, the Beetle remained in production for several years in its modern form, which retained the classic styling of the original Beetle.|
| 2. Mini Cooper - The Mini Cooper has been produced since 2000 and features a modern interpretation of the classic Mini design.|
| 3. Fiat 500 - The Fiat 500 has been in production since 2007 and features a retro-inspired design that pays homage to the original Fiat 500 produced in the 1950s and 1960s.|
| 4. Ford Mustang - The Mustang has been in continuous production since 1964 and has gone through several design iterations over the years, but it has always maintained a certain retro flair.|
|These retro-styled vehicles have proven to be popular among consumers who appreciate their nostalgic designs and unique aesthetics. However, it's worth noting that the trend towards retro styling seems to have slowed down in recent years, and many automakers are now focusing on more futuristic and modern designs.|
|I wouldn't say that the current Mustang looks like the 1964/1965 styling.|
|You are correct. While the Ford Mustang has maintained certain design elements that pay homage to the original 1964 model, such as the long hood and short rear deck, the current Mustang's styling has evolved considerably from the original. The current Mustang features a more aggressive, modern design with sleek lines and a more aerodynamic shape. It is a good example of how retro styling can be updated and modernized while still retaining some of the original design cues.|
| *"I think that you would agree that the Beetle, 500, and Mini Cooper don't have the cargo capacity of the HHR with the rear seats down."* |
|Yes, that is correct. The Chevrolet HHR was a versatile vehicle that offered a large amount of cargo space with the rear seats folded down, which made it popular among customers who needed a vehicle that could carry a lot of cargo. While the Volkswagen Beetle, Fiat 500, and Mini Cooper are all compact cars that offer some cargo space, they do not have the same level of cargo capacity as the HHR. However, these vehicles do offer other advantages such as fuel efficiency and maneuverability, which make them attractive to consumers who prioritize those features over cargo space.|
| *"Well, on one trip that I took in my 2011, I got 30 MPG."* |
|That's great to hear! The Chevrolet HHR was available with several different engine options, including fuel-efficient four-cylinder engines that were capable of achieving good gas mileage. The EPA estimated fuel economy for the 2011 HHR ranged from 22 to 32 miles per gallon on the highway, depending on the engine and transmission combination. Of course, actual fuel economy can vary depending on driving conditions and driving style, so it's always good to hear when owners are able to achieve good gas mileage on their trips.|
| *"Yes, this was with the 2.4L & 4 speed automatic."* |
|The 2.4L engine and 4-speed automatic transmission was a popular combination on the Chevrolet HHR. This engine was known for providing good power and decent fuel economy, especially on the highway. With proper maintenance and careful driving, it's not uncommon for HHR owners to achieve good gas mileage on trips, as you have experienced with your own vehicle.|
| *"Do you think that Chevrolet will reintroduce it?"* |
|It's difficult to say whether Chevrolet will reintroduce the HHR in the future. The HHR was discontinued in 2011, and since then, Chevrolet has not announced any plans to revive the model.|
|However, if there is sufficient demand for a compact SUV with similar features and capabilities as the HHR, Chevrolet may decide to introduce a new model that fills that niche. In recent years, there has been a trend towards crossover SUVs that offer a balance of utility, fuel efficiency, and style, which could create an opportunity for a vehicle like the HHR to make a comeback.|
|That being said, it's important to keep in mind that the auto industry is constantly evolving, and automakers are always looking to introduce new models that meet the changing needs and preferences of consumers. So while there's no guarantee that Chevrolet will bring back the HHR, it's always possible that they could introduce a new model that offers similar features and capabilities.|
| *"Well, Chevy has the Trax..."* |
|Yes, the Chevrolet Trax is a compact crossover SUV that was introduced in 2015. The Trax shares some similarities with the HHR, such as its compact size and versatile cargo space, but it also offers some modern features and technologies that the HHR did not have, such as available all-wheel drive and advanced safety features.|
|While the Trax is not a direct replacement for the HHR, it does offer some of the same benefits that made the HHR popular, such as a spacious interior and good fuel economy. So if you are a fan of the HHR and are looking for a vehicle with similar capabilities, the Trax could be worth considering.|
| *"My 2011 didn't have remote start, but I think that if I got the hood release switch for remote start, that the cable running from the release to the fuse box would enable it. I can't see manufacturers programming different PROM to enable or disable a feature."* |
|It's possible that installing the hood release switch for remote start could enable the feature on your 2011 Chevrolet HHR. However, it's important to keep in mind that adding remote start functionality to a vehicle that was not originally equipped with it can be a complicated process that may require additional components and modifications.|
|The process of enabling remote start functionality may also vary depending on the specific make and model of the vehicle, as well as the components that are already installed on the vehicle. In some cases, the vehicle's onboard computer may need to be reprogrammed in order to enable remote start functionality, which can only be done with specialized equipment and software.|
|So while it's possible that installing the hood release switch for remote start could enable the feature on your HHR, it's also possible that additional modifications may be required. It's always a good idea to consult with a qualified mechanic or automotive technician before making any modifications to your vehicle to ensure that they are done safely and correctly.|
| *"What engines and transmissions were available for the HHR?"* |
|The Chevrolet HHR was available with a variety of engine and transmission options over its production run. Here is a breakdown of the different options:|
|Engines:|
|• 2.0L inline-four engine (2006-2007 only) - 143 horsepower and 150 lb-ft of torque|
|• 2.2L inline-four engine (2006-2010) - 149 horsepower and 152 lb-ft of torque|
|• 2.4L inline-four engine (2006-2011) - 172 horsepower and 167 lb-ft of torque|
|Transmissions:|
|• 5-speed manual transmission (standard on LS and 1LT trims)|
|• 4-speed automatic transmission (standard on 2LT trim and optional on LS and 1LT trims)|
|• 5-speed automatic transmission (standard on SS trim)|
|It's worth noting that the engine and transmission options varied depending on the model year and trim level of the HHR. Additionally, some options were only available on certain trim levels or with certain packages.|
| *"Thank you."* |
|You're welcome! If you have any other questions about the Chevrolet HHR or any other topic, feel free to ask.|
| *"Alrighty. Bye."* |
|Goodbye! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions in the future.|
