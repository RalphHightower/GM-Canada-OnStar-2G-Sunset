# Hightower Cars OnStar Functionality Impacted by US Cellular CDMA 2G Sunset 

Canada sunsetted cellular 2G CDMA technology in 2015. [GM Canada](https://www.gm.ca/) üá®üá¶  figured out how to retain OnStar functionality in affected vehicles without using a dongle that plugs into the ODB-II port, which is [GM USA](https://www.gm.com/) üá∫üá∏  solution. A dongle that plugs into the ODB-II port is unacceptable to me.

[^1]: 2014 Chevrolet Cruze will be sold. Cruz is on its fourth turbocharger (counting the one installed at the factory).
[^2]: 2014 Chevrolet Cruze was totalled 2022-11-22. It will be replaced with a non-turbocharged car or SUV.
[^3]: Totalled 2023-01-26. Damn it! I loved the retro styling and with the rear seats down, it had enough cargo capacity for our household of two and two Beagles. We took a week-long trip to Florida with three Beagles. We had to "tetris-pack", but it worked.
