# Hightower Cars OnStar Functionality Impacted by US Cellular CDMA 2G Sunset 

Canada sunsetted cellular 2G CDMA technology in 2015. [GM Canada](https://www.gm.ca/) üá®üá¶  figured out how to retain OnStar functionality in affected vehicles without using a dongle that plugs into the ODB-II port, which is [GM USA](https://www.gm.com/) üá∫üá∏  solution. A dongle that plugs into the ODB-II port is unacceptable to me.

### 2011 Chevrolet HHR Sunroof Repair 
The following is not related to the cellular companies in America sunsetting cellular CDMA G2 technology. However, since I created this document for the OnStar 2G shutdown, this is a handy place to put it.

This frame is needed because the driver side pivot hold down is broken. When the sunroof is retracted, the slide arm that is supposed lower the wind baffle springs up, requiring two people to close the sunroof: 
1. one person is needed outside to hold the arm down for the window
2. the other person is needed inside to push the button to close the sunroof.

### 2011 Chevrolet HHR 2.4L I-4 Enable Remote Start?

This part is for HHR's built with remote starting. I don't think that Chevrolet would have different PROMs for specific features in a car. I think that this part will tell the HHR whether the hood is open or closed, if it will autostart. I read on an HHR forum where grounding a pin in the interior fuse box will enable remote starting.

[^1]: 2014 Chevrolet Cruze will be sold. Cruz is on its fourth turbocharger (counting the one installed at the factory).
[^2]: 2014 Chevrolet Cruze was totalled 2022-11-22. It will be replaced with a non-turbocharged car or SUV.
[^3]: Totalled 2023-01-26. Damn it! I loved the retro styling and with the rear seats down, it had enough cargo capacity for our household of two and two Beagles. We took a week-long trip to Florida with three Beagles. We had to "tetris-pack", but it worked.
