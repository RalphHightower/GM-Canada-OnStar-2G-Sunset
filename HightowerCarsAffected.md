# Hightower Cars OnStar Functionality Impacted by US Cellular CDMA 2G Sunset 

Canada sunseted cellular 2G CDMA technology in 2015. [GM Canada](https://www.gm.ca/) üá®üá¶  figured out how to retain OnStar functionality in affected vehicles without using a dongle that plugs into the ODB-II port, which is [GM USA](https://www.gm.com/) üá∫üá∏  solution. A dongle that plugs into the ODB-II port is unacceptable to me.

### 2011 Chevrolet HHR Sunroof Repair 
The following is not related to the cellular companies in America sunseting cellular CDMA G2 technology. However, since I created this document for the OnStar 2G shutdown, this is a handy place to put it.

This frame is needed because the driver side pivot hold down is broken. When the sunroof is retracted, the slide arm that is supposed lower the wind baffle springs up, requiring two people to close the sunroof: 
1. one person is needed outside to hold the arm down for the window
2. the other person is needed inside to push the button to close the sunroof.

### 2011 Chevrolet HHR 2.4L I-4 Enable Remote Start?

This part is for HHR's built with remote starting. I don't think that Chevrolet would have different PROMs for specific features in a car. I think that this part will tell the HHR whether the hood is open or closed, if it will autostart. I read on an HHR forum where grounding a pin in the interior fuse box will enable remote starting.
